original C code

C:\z88dk_1.6\GENESIS\original Genesis C code
C:\z88dk_1.6\GENESIS\genesis-zx-master\src

is confusing on ram6

makefile 		has ram6.bin
makefile.linix 	does not have ram6
makefile.old 	does not have ram6
makefile.win	does not have ram6

template.txt	refers to ram6

a search through the files only shows template.txt and makefile having any reference to RAM6


in the references it does find

genesis.tzx:  main.bin engine.bin sprites.bin ram3.bin ram4.bin ram0.bin ram6.bin rwks_logo.scr loading.scr
	buildtzx -l 3 -i template.txt -o genesis.tzx -n GENESiS

ram6.bin: menu.asm genesis_title.bin title_hiscores.bin credits_bkg.bin move.asm behav.asm maindefs.asm
	pasmo menu.asm menu.bin menu.sym
	pasmo move.asm move.bin move.sym
	pasmo behav.asm behav.bin behav.sym
	cat menu.bin move.bin behav.bin > ram6.bin
	
FOR RIGHT NOW, USE RAM6 for MAIN MENU
