# genesis_refactoring

This is a refactoring of the Genesis Dawn of a New Day game.

Genesis: Dawn of a New Day was written by Utopian released for the ZX Spectrum 128k machine.

Written in an old version of Z88DK, this ongoing project hopes to convert to a more modern version
of Z88dk to include SECTIONS and PUBLIC declairtors.  This should be able to allow one to modify code
without having to keep track to of where routines and variables are placed in memory.

The original game and source code is available at
